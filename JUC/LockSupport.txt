/**
 * Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other
 * synchronization classes.
 *
 LockSupport基于线程最原始阻塞，提供锁的创建，服务于其他同步器
 * <p>This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit
 * (in the sense of the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore
 * Semaphore} class). A call to {@code park} will return immediately
 * if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise
 * it <em>may</em> block.  A call to {@code unpark} makes the permit
 * available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores
 * though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.)
 *
 LockSupport与所有用到它的每一个线程相关联，permit在某种意义上，可以理解为
 信号量java.util.concurrent.Semaphore。
如果permit可以用，park函数会立即返回，则消费permit，否则肯能阻塞。
如果permit没有可利用的，则unpark会使permit可以用。与信号量不同的是，
permits不允许累计，最多只能有一个。


 * <p>Methods {@code park} and {@code unpark} provide efficient
 * means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the
 * problems that cause the deprecated methods {@code Thread.suspend}
 * and {@code Thread.resume} to be unusable for such purposes: Races
 * between one thread invoking {@code park} and another thread trying
 * to {@code unpark} it will preserve liveness, due to the
 * permit. Additionally, {@code park} will return if the caller's
 * thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The
 * {@code park} method may also return at any other time, for "no
 * reason", so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks
 * conditions upon return. In this sense {@code park} serves as an
 * optimization of a "busy wait" that does not waste as much time
 * spinning, but must be paired with an {@code unpark} to be
 * effective.
 *
park和unpark提供有效分方式blocking and unblocking线程，并且不会遇到Thread.suspend
和Thread.resume方法引起的问题：一个线程park，另一个线程unpark，有由于permit，
线程可能处于liveness（运行）状态。如果当前线程处于中断状态，park会立即返回，
同时支持超时等待park。由于未知的原因，park方法会在任何时候返回，所以必须
循环检查返回的条件。park方法是busy wait的一种优化，不会浪费太多的时间自旋，
park必须与unpark配合使用。

 * <p>The three forms of {@code park} each also support a
 * {@code blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while
 * the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to
 * identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may
 * access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these
 * forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is
 * strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a
 * {@code blocker} within a lock implementation is {@code this}.
 *
 park方法有三种形式，其中一种带Obejct参数的  
 public static void park(Object blocker) 
 。当线程阻塞时，记录线程，以便监控和诊断工具，确定阻塞的原因。
 我们可以用getBlocker方法获取阻塞线程。强烈建议使用带参数的park方法，
 而不是无参数的park方法。待参数的park，阻塞的线程，内部要提供一个lock的实现。


 * <p>These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating
 * higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves
 * useful for most concurrency control applications. 

 这些方法是为方便创建高质量的同步器，而设计，不是为大多数的并发应用。
 * The {@code park}
 * method is designed for use only in constructions of the form:
 * <pre>while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }</pre>
 * where neither {@code canProceed} nor any other actions prior to the
 * call to {@code park} entail locking or blocking.  Because only one
 * permit is associated with each thread, any intermediary uses of
 * {@code park} could interfere with its intended effects.
 *
 这一段就不翻译了，暂时理解的不是很透彻



 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out
 * non-reentrant lock class:
 这是一个基于FIFO队列的非重入锁的实现
 * <pre>{@code
 * class FIFOMutex {
 *   private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false); //原子锁
 *   private final Queue<Thread> waiters//线程等待队列
 *     = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Thread>();
 *   //加锁
 *   public void lock() {
 *     boolean wasInterrupted = false;
       //获取当前线程加入到，线程等待队列
 *     Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
 *     waiters.add(current);
 *
 *     // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock
       //当前线程，不是队列的头部，并且获取锁失败，则park当前线程
 *     while (waiters.peek() != current ||
 *            !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
 *        LockSupport.park(this);
          //如果线程处于中断状态，则wasInterrupted为true
 *        if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting
 *          wasInterrupted = true;
 *     }
 *     //如果是队列的头部，且获取锁成功，从队列中移除，当前线程
 *     waiters.remove();
 *     if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit
 *        current.interrupt();
 *   }
 *   //解锁
 *   public void unlock() {
 *     locked.set(false);//设置锁为打开状态
 *     LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());//unpark队列头部线程
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
